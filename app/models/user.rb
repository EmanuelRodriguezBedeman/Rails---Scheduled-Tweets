Fields
    -email:string
    -password_digest:string

Virtual attributes added by digest (secure way to store passwords)
    -password:string
    -password_confirmation:string

This works by saving the password inside the has_secure_password and password,
check that both match and then, it'll go into bcrypt to hash it  (secure it).
